## Anaconda

Anaconda is a distribution of software that comes with `conda`, Python, and over 150 scientific packages and their dependencies. The application `conda` is a package and environment manager.

- To install package with specified version number: `conda install numpy=1.10`
- To uninstall a package: `conda remove package_name`
- To update all packages within an environment: `conda update --all`
- To list installed packages: `conda list`
- To search for a package name: `conda search *search_term*`
- To create an environment: `conda create -n env_name list of packages` / `conda create -n py2 python=2`
- To enter an environment: `conda activate my_env`
- To leave an environment: `conda deactivate`
- To save an environment's packages, dependencies and versions to YAML file: `conda env export > environment.yaml`. This file can now be shared and others will be able to create the same environment you used for the project
- To create an environment from an environment file: `conda env create -f environment.yaml`
- To list all created environments: `conda env list`
- To remove an environment: `conda env remove -n env_name`

#### Sharing environments

When sharing on GitHub, it's good practice to commit an environment file to make it easier for people to install all the dependencies.
Ideally also include a pip requirements.txt file using `pip freeze` for people not using conda.

## Jupyter Notebooks

- The notebook is a web application that allows you to combine explanatory text, math equations, code, and visualizations all in one easily sharable document.
- Notebooks have quickly become an essential tool when working with data. You'll find them being used for data cleaning and exploration, visualization, machine learning, and big data analysis.
- Notebooks are just big JSON files with the extension `.ipynb`.
- Notebooks are also rendered automatically on GitHub.
- By default, the notebook server runs at http://localhost:8888.
- You should consider installing Notebook Conda to help manage your environments: `conda install nb_conda`. You will be able to access any of your conda environments when choosing a kernel.
- Refer to `working-with-code-cells.ipynb` for useful tips when working with notebooks.
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and [LaTeX Tutorial](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/)
- If you want to time how long it takes for a whole cell to run, youâ€™d use `%%timeit`.
- To render figures directly in the notebook: `%matplotlib inline`
- To turn on the interactive debugger and inspect variables in the current namespace: `%pdb`
- Other [magic commands](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html)
- To convert notebook into html: `jupyter nbconvert --to html notebook.ipynb`
- To create a slideshow from the notebook file and see it in the browser: `jupyter nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to slides --post serve`

## Numpy

- Check out `numpy arrays.ipynb`

* NumPy stands for Numerical Python and it's a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. Built on top of C.
* Check out version with `conda list numpy`
* NumPy arrays are several orders of magnitude much faster than regular python lists. This speed comes from the nature of NumPy arrays being memory-efficient and from optimized algorithms used by NumPy for doing arithmetic, statistical, and linear algebra operations.
* Also supports multidimensional arrays to represent vectors and matrices. It is optimized for matrix operations, largely used in ML algorithms.
* Large number of optimized built-in complex mathematical functions.
* Pandas are built on top of Numpy.
* Numpy arrays ndarray -> n-dimensional array. An ndarray is a multidimensional array of elements all of the same type (string or number).
* When we create an ndarray with both floats and integers, NumPy assigns its elements a float64 dtype. This is called **upcasting**. Since all the elements of an ndarray must be of the same type, in this case NumPy upcasts the integers to floats in order to avoid losing precision in numerical computations.
* Specifying the data type of the ndarray can be useful in cases when you don't want NumPy to accidentally choose the wrong data type, or when you only need certain amount of precision in your calculations and you want to save memory.
* Once you create an ndarray, you may want to save it to a file to be read later or to be used by another program: `np.save(filename, array_name)`. To later load it into the notebook: `np.load('array_name.npy')`
* `np.zeros((3,4), dtype=int)`
* `np.ones((3,4), dtype=int)`
* `np.full((4,3), 5)`
* `np.eye(3)`
* `np.diag([10,20,30,40])`
* `np.arange(start, stop, step)`, start is inclusive, stop is exclusive, step is third argument
* `np.linspace(start, stop, N)`, start and stop are both inclusive. Passing in endpoint=False it will exclude the endpoint.
* `np.reshape(ndarray, new_shape)`
* `np.random.random(shape` or `np.random.randint(start, end, shape)`
* NumPy allows you create random ndarrays with numbers drawn from various probability distributions such as: `np.random.normal(mean, standard_deviation, size=shape)`
* To access elements: `array_name[row][column]` or `array_name[row, column]`
* To delete elements: `np.delete(ndarray, elements, axis)`. For rank 2 ndarrays, axis = 0 is used to select rows, and axis = 1 is used to select columns.
* To add elements: `np.append(ndarray, elements, axis)`.
* To insert elements: `np.insert(ndarray, index, elements, axis)`
* Slicing does not create a copy, need to call the copy method.
* To get only unique values: `np.unique(ndarray)`
* To grab diagonally below main diagonal: `np.diag(nparray, k=-1)`
* Sorting: When `np.sort()` is used as a function, it sorts the ndrrays out of place, meaning, that it doesn't change the original ndarray being sorted. However, when you use sort as a method, `ndarray.sort()` sorts the ndarray in place, meaning, that the original array will be changed to the sorted one.
* **Broadcasting** is the term used to describe how NumPy handles element-wise arithmetic operations with ndarrays of different shapes. For example, broadcasting is used implicitly when doing arithmetic operations between scalars and ndarrays. When performing element-wise operations, the shapes of the ndarrays being operated on, must have the same shape or be broadcastable.

- **It is important to remember that one big difference between Python lists and ndarrays, is that unlike Python lists, all the elements of an ndarray must be of the same type.**

## Pandas

* [Official docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
* Check out notebook pandas.ipynb
* Pandas is a package for data manipulation and analysis in Python. Built on top of Numpy.
* Pandas **Series** and Pandas **DataFrames** allow us to work with *labeled* and *relational* data in an easy and intuitive manner
* It often happens that large datasets donâ€™t come ready to be fed into your learning algorithms, will often have missing values, outliers, incorrect values, etcâ€¦ Having data with a lot of missing or bad values, for example, is not going to allow your machine learning algorithms to perform well. Therefore, one very important step in machine learning is to look at your data first and make sure it is well suited for your training algorithm by doing some basic data analysis.

**Series**

* A Pandas series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold many data types, such as numbers or strings. Unlike Numpy ndarrays, you can assign index label to each element and it can hold data of different types.
* Since we can access elements in various ways, in order to remove any ambiguity to whether we are referring to an index label or numerical index, Pandas Series have two attributes, `.loc` and `.iloc` to explicitly state what we mean. The attribute `.loc` stands for location and it is used to explicitly state that we are using a labeled index. Similarly, the attribute `.iloc` stands for integer location and it is used to explicitly state that we are using a numerical index.
* Series are mutable. Delete items in place: `pd.drop(index, inplace=True)`.

**DataFrames**
* We see that DataFrames are displayed in tabular form, much like an Excel spreadsheet. Also notice that the row labels of the DataFrame are built from the union of the index labels of the two Pandas Series we used to construct the dictionary. And the column labels of the DataFrame are taken from the keys of the dictionary.
* Another thing to notice is that the columns are arranged alphabetically and not in the order given in the dictionary. We will see later that this won't happen when we load data into a DataFrame from a data file.
* NaN stands for Not a Number, and is Pandas way of indicating that it doesn't have a value for that particular row and column index. Whenever a DataFrame is created, if a particular column doesn't have values for a particular row index, Pandas will put a NaN value there. If we were to feed this data into a machine learning algorithm we will have to remove these NaN values first.
* To access `dataframe[column][row]`

**Matplotlib and Seaborn**

- Bar charts for qualitative variables
- Histograms for quantitative variables

In short, a **tidy** dataset is a tabular dataset where:

1. each variable is a column
2. each observation is a row
3. each type of observational unit is a table

In practice, you may need to perform tidying work before exploration. You should be comfortable with reshaping your data or perform transformations to split or combine features in your data, resulting in new data columns. This work should be performed in the wrangling stage of the data analysis process.

- Bar Charts
A bar chart is used to depict the distribution of a categorical variable. In a bar chart, each level of the categorical variable is depicted with a bar, whose height indicates the frequency of data points that take on that level.
`sns.countplot(data, x | y, color, order)`. `color_palette()` returns a list of RBG tuples.

## Intro to Neural Networks

The design of the Artificial Neural Network was inspired by the biological one. The neurons used in the artificial network below are essentially mathematical functions.

Each network has:

Input neurons- which we refer to as the input layer of neurons
Output neurons- which we refer to as the output layer of neurons
and

Internal neurons- which we refer to as the hidden layer of neurons. Each neural network can have many hidden layers

Notice that there is no connection between the number of inputs, number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer or number of outputs.

Notice the "lines" connecting the different neurons?

In practice, these lines symbolize a coefficient (a scalar) that is mathematically connecting one neuron to the next. These coefficients are called weights.

The "lines" connect each neuron in a specific layer to all of the neurons on the following. For example, in our example, you can see how each neuron in the hidden layer is connected to a neuron in the output one.

Since there are so many weights connecting one layer to the next, we mathematically organize those coefficients in a matrix, denoted as the weight matrix.

Later you will learn that when we train an artificial neural network, we are actually looking for the best set of weights that will give us a desired outcome.

![Neural network](./neural_network.png)

When working with neural networks we have 2 primary phases: Training and Evaluation.
During the training phase, we take the data set (also called the training set), which includes many pairs of inputs and their corresponding targets (outputs). Our goal is to find a set of weights that would best map the inputs to the desired outputs.

In the evaluation phase, we use the network that was created in the training phase, apply our new inputs and expect to obtain the desired outputs.

The training phase will include two steps: Feedforward and Backpropagation.

We will repeat these steps as many times as we need until we decide that our system has reached the best set of weights, giving us the best possible outputs.

As you saw in the video above, vector $\vec{h'}$ of the hidden layer will be calculated by multiplying the input vector with the weight matrix $W^{1}$ the following way:

${\vec{h'}=(\vec{x}W^1)}$

After finding $\vec{h'}$ we need an **activation function** $\Phi$.

This activation function finalizes the computation of the hidden layer's values.

We can use the following two equations to express the final hidden vector $\vec{h'}$:

$\vec{h} = \Phi(\vec{x} W^1 )$

Since $W_{ij}$ represents the weight component in the weight matrix, connecting neuron i from the input to neuron j in the hidden layer, we can also write these calculations using a *linear combination*: (notice that in this example we have n inputs and only 3 hidden neurons):

$h_1=\Phi(x_1W_{11}+x_2W_{21}+...+x_3W_{n1})$
$h_2=\Phi(x_1W_{12}+x_2W_{22}+...+x_3W_{n2})$
$h_3=\Phi(x_1W_{13}+x_2W_{23}+...+x_3W_{n3})$

We finished our first step, finding $\vec{h}$ and now need to find the output $\vec{y}$. The process of calculating the output vector is mathematically similar to that of calculating the vector of the hidden layer. We use, again, a vector by matrix multiplication. The vector is the newly calculated hidden layer and the matrix is the one connecting the hidden layer to the output.
â€‹
Essentially, each new layer in an neural network is calculated by a vector by matrix multiplication, where the vector represents the inputs to the new layer and the matrix is the one connecting these new inputs to the next layer.
